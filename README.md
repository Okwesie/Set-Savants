# Propositional Logic, Set Theory, and Boolean Algebra Converter

## Overview

Welcome to the Set Servants project! This project focuses on the intersection of propositional logic, set theory, and Boolean algebra. We have developed a program that enables users to convert propositional expressions—containing variables, conjunctions, disjunctions, negations, and truth values—into various forms, including dual, set notation, and Boolean expressions.

## Key Concepts

- **Propositional Logic:** A branch of logic that studies the logical relationships between propositions, statements, or sentences. Propositional logic uses logical connectives to join or modify propositions, with each proposition having a truth value of either true or false.

- **Set Theory:** A branch of mathematical logic that deals with sets—collections of distinct objects considered as a single entity. Elements within a set are typically denoted by symbols representing membership and cardinality.

- **Boolean Algebra:** A system of algebra that provides the operations and rules for working with the sets 0 and 1.

## Features

- **User Input:** The program accepts logical expressions with propositional variables (p, q, r, s, o), conjunctions (^), disjunctions (V), negations (-), and truth values (T, F).

- **Conversion Options:** Users can choose to:
  - Compute the dual of the expression
  - Convert the expression to set notation
  - Transform the expression into Boolean algebra

- **Interactive Menu:** The program features a menu-driven interface, allowing users to continuously select operations or exit the program.

## Error Handling

- **Input Validation:** The program includes a list of acceptable inputs and checks each user entry against this list. If an invalid input is detected, an error message is displayed, and the program stops.

- **Universal Symbols:**
  - **Propositional Logic:** Variables (p, q, r, s, o), conjunction (^), disjunction (V), negation (-), true (T), false (F).
  - **Boolean Algebra:** "Or" (+), "And" (.), complement (').
  - **Set Theory:** Symbols for conjunction(∧), disjunction(∨), intersection(∩), union(∪), and the universal set(U).

## Testing

The program has been tested against various edge cases, including simple atomic expressions and complex expressions with multiple logical operators and truth values, to ensure its robustness and accuracy.

## Findings

Through this project, we have highlighted the interconnectedness of propositional logic, set theory, and Boolean algebra. We anticipate that the insights gained from this project will enhance understanding and applications in related fields.
